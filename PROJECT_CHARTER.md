# PQC Migration Audit - Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** PQC Migration Audit  
**Project Code:** PQC-MA  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-01  
**Project Manager:** Daniel Schmidt (daniel@terragonlabs.com)

## Executive Summary

The PQC Migration Audit project delivers an automated tool for identifying quantum-vulnerable cryptographic implementations and facilitating migration to post-quantum secure alternatives. With the quantum computing threat emerging by 2030 and NIST standardizing PQC algorithms in 2024, organizations need immediate action to achieve crypto-agility.

## Problem Statement

**Core Problem:** Organizations lack visibility into quantum-vulnerable cryptographic implementations across their codebases and systems, creating significant security risks as quantum computing capabilities advance.

**Business Impact:**
- **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attacks** are already collecting encrypted data for future quantum decryption
- **Regulatory compliance** requirements emerging for crypto-agility
- **Supply chain vulnerabilities** from third-party cryptographic dependencies
- **Technical debt** accumulation as classical crypto becomes obsolete

**Market Urgency:**
- NIST standardized PQC algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA) in August 2024
- Industry estimates suggest 10-15 year migration timeline for large enterprises
- Quantum supremacy for cryptographically relevant problems expected by 2030-2035

# Advanced Security Scanning Setup

## Overview

This document outlines the multi-layered security scanning approach for the PQC Migration Audit tool, covering SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and cryptographic-specific assessments.

## Scanning Tools Configuration

### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

#### CodeQL Configuration
```yaml
# .github/codeql/codeql-config.yml
name: "CodeQL Config"
queries:
  - uses: security-extended
  - uses: security-and-quality
paths-ignore:
  - "tests/**"
  - "docs/**"
```

#### Bandit Configuration
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.bandit]
exclude_dirs = ["tests", "docs"]
skips = ["B101"]  # Skip assert_used test
```

### 2. Dependency Scanning

#### Safety Configuration
```ini
# .safety-policy.yml
security:
  ignore-vulnerabilities:
    # Example: temporarily ignore non-exploitable issues
    # 12345: "False positive for development dependency"
  continue-on-vulnerability-error: false
```

#### Semgrep Rules
```yaml
# .semgrep.yml
rules:
  - id: hardcoded-crypto-key
    pattern: |
      $KEY = "..."
    message: Hardcoded cryptographic key detected
    languages: [python]
    severity: ERROR
    
  - id: weak-crypto-algorithm
    patterns:
      - pattern: hashlib.md5(...)
      - pattern: hashlib.sha1(...)
    message: Weak cryptographic algorithm
    languages: [python]
    severity: WARNING
```

## Cryptography-Specific Scanning

### Custom Rules for PQC Assessment

#### Vulnerable Pattern Detection
- RSA key generation (< 3072 bits)
- ECDSA/ECDH usage
- SHA-1 in signature schemes
- Hardcoded cryptographic constants

#### Reference Standards
- NIST SP 800-208: Post-Quantum Cryptography Guidelines
- RFC 8391: XMSS Hash-Based Signatures
- CRYSTALS-Kyber specification

## Container Security Scanning

### Trivy Configuration
```yaml
# .trivyignore
# Ignore false positives
CVE-2023-12345
```

### Grype Integration
```yaml
# .grype.yml
ignore:
  - vulnerability: "CVE-2023-*"
    package:
      name: "test-dependency"
```

## Compliance Frameworks

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **Identify**: Asset inventory and risk assessment
- **Protect**: Access controls and data security
- **Detect**: Continuous monitoring
- **Respond**: Incident response procedures
- **Recover**: Business continuity planning

### OWASP ASVS Level 2
- Authentication verification
- Session management
- Access control verification
- Validation, sanitization and encoding
- Stored cryptography verification

## Automated Reporting

### Security Dashboard
- Vulnerability trends over time
- CVSS score distributions
- Remediation status tracking
- Compliance posture indicators

### Integration Points
- GitHub Security Advisories
- SARIF format compatibility
- Slack/Teams notifications
- Jira ticket creation

## Manual Security Testing

### Cryptographic Review Checklist
- [ ] Key generation uses secure randomness
- [ ] Proper key storage and lifecycle management
- [ ] Algorithm selection follows NIST recommendations
- [ ] Side-channel attack resistance
- [ ] Quantum-safe migration paths identified

### Penetration Testing Scope
- Input validation testing
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Privilege escalation testing
- Data exposure analysis
- Cryptographic implementation flaws

## Continuous Monitoring

### Security Metrics
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)
- False positive rate
- Coverage percentage

### Alerting Thresholds
- Critical vulnerabilities: Immediate notification
- High severity: 4-hour SLA
- Medium severity: 24-hour SLA
- Compliance violations: 8-hour SLA

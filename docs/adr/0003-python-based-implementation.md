# ADR-0003: Python-based Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose a primary programming language for implementing the pqc-migration-audit tool. The language choice affects development velocity, ecosystem integration, maintainability, and adoption potential.

Key considerations:
- Rich ecosystem for AST parsing and code analysis
- Extensive cryptographic libraries and PQC implementations
- Strong tooling for CLI applications and GitHub Actions
- Developer productivity and community support
- Performance requirements for large codebases
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Decision
We will implement pqc-migration-audit primarily in Python 3.8+, with the following technical choices:

**Core Technologies:**
- Click for CLI interface and command structure
- Rich for terminal output and progress visualization
- GitPython for repository analysis
- Jinja2 for report templating and patch generation

**AST Parsing:**
- Python: Built-in `ast` module
- Java: `javalang` or `tree-sitter-java`
- Go: `tree-sitter-go`
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `tree-sitter-javascript`

**Packaging & Distribution:**
- PyPI for package distribution
- setuptools for build system
- GitHub Actions for cross-platform building

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Rapid development with extensive ecosystem
- Excellent libraries for code analysis and parsing
- Strong CI/CD and automation tooling
- Easy integration with existing Python security tools
- Simple installation via pip

**Negative:**
- Potential performance limitations for very large codebases
- Runtime dependency on Python interpreter
- GIL limitations for pure CPU-bound parallel processing

**Neutral:**
- Performance-critical components can be implemented in Rust/C++ if needed
- Multi-language parsing handled through external parsers/tree-sitter

# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status
Template - Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded

## Context
This template defines the standard format for Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the pqc-migration-audit project. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, consequences, and rationale.

## Decision
We will use Michael Nygard's ADR format with the following sections:

1. **Title**: Short noun phrase describing the decision
2. **Status**: Current state of the decision
3. **Context**: Forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local
4. **Decision**: Response to these forces
5. **Consequences**: Context after applying the decision (positive, negative, neutral)

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Consistent documentation format across the project
- Clear decision rationale for future reference
- Improved architectural transparency
- Easier onboarding for new team members

**Negative:**
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Risk of outdated documentation if not maintained

**Neutral:**
- Decisions will be tracked in version control
- ADRs become part of the project's institutional memory
